# CSUN-FSAE-BANDSAW-MANUAL
Written by: 2022-2023 CSUN FSAE TEAM

The purpose of this guide is to provide a set of clear instruction on the use of the Bandsaw Machine. This document applies to all persons who may operate, maintain, or interact with the bandsaw machine. It is the ultimate responsibility of the student to decide on whether they are prepared to use the equipment and if they are not, it is their responsibility to escalate their concerns to a member of faculty such a senior design professor, machine shop technician, or HAAS lab technician.

## SAFETY ‚ö†Ô∏è

* Always wear proper PPE
* ALWAYS WEAR SAFETY GLASSES WHEN USING THE BANDSAW
* NEVER STEP AWAY FROM THE BANDSAW WHILE THE MACHINE IS RUNNING
* MAKE SURE THE STOCK IS SECURELY PLACED IN VICE BEFORE CUTTING
* MAKE SURE COOLANT IS RUNNING ON THE PART BEING CUT
* **DO NOT TOUCH AND DO NOT USE TO RAISE BANDSAW** ‚ùå ![20220628_154107](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80706125/176317178-cc578a06-a91e-4aab-905f-86e1dc70544c.jpg)

## OPERATION ‚öíÔ∏è
* Inspect Bandsaw Machine 
 * Before using the Bandsaw machine, make sure that the machine is operational. If the bandsaw machine is not   operational,refer to the maintenance procedure or ask a faculty member to fix the machine.  
     * This means inspect the blade, cables, coolant/oil, and control panels.
     * The blade should be in good condition with no large scratches or appear bent.
     * The cables should be out of the way and in good condition with insulation encasing the entire wire. 
     * The coolant/oil should be at a high level and appear light blue, refer to HAAS machines for reference.
     * Control panel should be clean and in good condition.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80706125/178127883-ec07ffac-e279-40fb-815b-cf5758fd3b46.png)

* Secure Material that needs to be cut
   * Use the clamps on the bandsaw machine to tightly secure your material. To adjust the clamps, simply spin the wheel handle on the lefthand side of the machine in a clockwise direction. If a major adjustment needs to be made simply raise the tab behind the cutting blade and relocate it to the distance desired. The clamps will NOT be adjusted if the tab is not secured first.

   * NEVER TOUCH BLADE SAW ADJUSTMENT (above the wheel handle). The only reason someone should touch it is if it falls off. If this happens contact a faculty member.

* Cutting Sequence
   * Once your material is secured, adjust the setting on the bandsaw machine control panel.

      * To adjust the speed of how fast the saw will cut through the material, adjust the cutting speed handle (5th from the left) accordingly. (For more speed, move the speed handle clockwise. To go slower, move the speed handle counterclockwise.).
      * To adjust the output of coolant nozzle, adjust the handle (4th from the left) accordingly.
      * To turn on the bandsaw machine, simply press the ON button (2nd from the left, green button)
      * The EMERGENCY STOP button is the big red button (3rd from the left) 
   * Once all the settings have been adjusted to the users liking, aim the nozzle where the bandsaw will cut the material. Afterwards, activate the bandsaw machine by adjusting the speed handle. It should noted that once the speed handle has been adjusted, the bandsaw machine will automatically begin coming down.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80706125/178128376-1974ad1d-04a5-4a03-a9cd-66693ac497d6.png)
   * IMPORTANT: When bandsaw machine is active, user should not leave the area until the cut is complete. In addition, the user should NEVER press the button. The bandsaw machine will touch the button when it fully comes down which will turn off the machine. 
   
* Aftermath
   * Once your material is successfully cut: raise the bandsaw machine cover, loosen the clamps by rotating the wheel handle counterclockwise, remove the material, and clean the machine.
