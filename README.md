# CSUN-FSAE-BANDSAW-MANUAL
The purpose of this guide is to provide a set of clear instruction on the use of the Bandsaw Machine. This document applies to all persons who may operate, maintain, or interact with the bandsaw machine. It is the ultimate responsibility of the student to decide on whether they are prepared to use the equipment and if they are not, it is their responsibility to escalate their concerns to a member of faculty such a senior design professor, machine shop technician, or HAAS lab technician.

## OPERATION ‚öíÔ∏è
* Inspect Bandsaw Machine 
   * Before using the Bandsaw machine, make sure that the machine is operational. If the bandsaw machine is not operational,refer to the maintenance procedure or ask a faculty member to fix the machine.  
    * This means inspect the blade, cables, coolant/oil, and control panels.
    * The blade should be in good condition with no large scratches or appear bent.
    * The cables should be out of the way and in good condition with insulation encasing the entire wire. 
    * The coolant/oil should be at a high level and appear light blue, refer to HAAS machines for reference.
    * Control panel should be clean and in good condition.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80706125/178127883-ec07ffac-e279-40fb-815b-cf5758fd3b46.png)

* Secure Material that needs to be cut
   * Use the clamps on the bandsaw machine to tightly secure your material. To adjust the clamps, simply spin the wheel handle on the lefthand side of the machine in a clockwise direction. If a major adjustment needs to be made simply raise the tab behind the cutting blade and relocate it to the distance desired. The clamps will NOT be adjusted if the tab is not secured first.

   * NEVER TOUCH BLADE SAW ADJUSTMENT (above the wheel handle). The only reason someone should touch it is if it falls off. If this happens contact a faculty member.
